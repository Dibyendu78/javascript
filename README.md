What is Node.js

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chrome's core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.


Why Node.js

Node.js is a cross-platform runtime, perfect for a wide range of use cases. Its huge community makes it easy to get started. It uses the V8 engine to compile JavaScript and runs at lightning-fast speeds. Node.js applications are very scalable and maintainable. Cross-platform support allows the creation of all kinds of applications - desktop apps, software as a service, and even mobile applications. Node.js is perfect for data-intensive and real-time applications since it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient. With such a huge community, a vast collection of Node.js packages is available to simplify and boost development.


Running Node.js Code

The usual way to run a Node.js program is to run the globally available node command (once you install Node.js) and pass the name of the file you want to execute.
