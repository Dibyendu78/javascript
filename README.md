What is Node.jsðŸ”ƒ

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chrome's core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.


Why Node.jsðŸ”ƒ

Node.js is a cross-platform runtime, perfect for a wide range of use cases. Its huge community makes it easy to get started. It uses the V8 engine to compile JavaScript and runs at lightning-fast speeds. Node.js applications are very scalable and maintainable. Cross-platform support allows the creation of all kinds of applications - desktop apps, software as a service, and even mobile applications. Node.js is perfect for data-intensive and real-time applications since it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient. With such a huge community, a vast collection of Node.js packages is available to simplify and boost development.


Running Node.js CodeðŸš€

The usual way to run a Node.js program is to run the globally available node command (once you install Node.js) and pass the name of the file you want to execute.

Global Install vs Local InstallðŸš€

NodeJS and NPM allow two methods of installing dependencies/packages: Local and Global. This is mainly used when adding a package or dependency as part of a specific project you're working on. The package would be installed (with its dependencies) in node_modules folder under your project. In addition, in package.json file there will be a new line added for the installed dependency under the label dependencies. At this point - you can start using the package in your NodeJS code by importing the package. Unlike the local install, you can install packages and dependencies globally. This would install it in a system path, and these packages would be available to any program which runs on this specific computer. This method is often used for installing command line tools (for example, even npm program is a Globally installed npm package).

npxðŸš€

npx is a very powerful command that's been available in npm starting version 5.2, released in July 2017. If you don't want to install npm, you can install npx as a standalone package. npx lets you run code built with Node.js and published through the npm registry.
